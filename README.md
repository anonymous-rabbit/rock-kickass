## About
Rock Kickass is a platformer that follows an android and two wacky scientists whose lab has come under attack by evil robot forces.

As Rock Kickass you must fight your way through swarms of enemies, merging their code as you kill them, so that you can gain their powers in order to survive.

## Game Design
We wanted to make a game that 

* is fun to play
* had a odd storyline and characters that would be introduced using cutscenes
* had a kill-for-skill upgrade system
* could be brought into as many platforms as possible

## Tech
Rock Kickass is built on [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com). All artwork was created in Photoshop or Paint.net. Sound Effects were made with [SFXR}(http://code.google.com/p/sfxr/).
